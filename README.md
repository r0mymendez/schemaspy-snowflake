# ‚ùÑÔ∏èSnowflake SchemaSpy  üê≥ Docker Compose

## Overview

This project sets up a Docker Compose environment for utilizing [SchemaSpy](https://schemaspy.org/) with [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/es/). 

* [SchemaSpy](https://schemaspy.org/) is a tool that generates an HTML representation of a database schema's relationships, providing insights into the database structure.

* [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/es/) is a cloud-based data storage and processing service that provides a highly scalable and fully managed data storage environment. Its architecture is built on the separation of storage and computing, allowing elastic scalability and optimal performance.


## üöÄ Benefits of SchemaSpy
* Visual representation of the database schema.
* Relationship insights between tables.
* HTML report for easy sharing and documentation.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:

- üê≥ Docker
- üêô Docker Compose
- ‚ùÑÔ∏è Snowflake account (You can create an account with a 30-day free trial which includes $400 worth of free usage.)
  
# Usage

## Clone this repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/r0mymendez/schemaspy-snowflake.git
   cd schemaspy-snowflake
   ```
## Snowflake Configuration
At this stage, you need to configure the configuration file located at the following path: config/snowflake.properties. This configuration will be used to establish the connection to Snowflake, so it is necessary to modify the **account**, **role**, **warehouse**, **schema**, and **database** settings.

```bash
schemaspy.t=snowflake
schemaspy.u=<user>
schemaspy.p=<password>
schemaspy.account=<account>
schemaspy.role=<role
schemaspy.warehouse=<warehouse>
schemaspy.db=<database>
schemaspy.s=<schema>
```

### Account 
Below is an example of an account URL. However, you only need to use a portion of it in the configuration:

* Full account URL: https://nl1111.eu-west-3.aws.snowflakecomputing.com
* Account to use in the configuration: nl1111.eu-west-3.aws

## üêô Build and run the Docker Compose environment
This command will build the Docker image and start the container.

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-snowflake.yaml up
```

# üîç Schemapy
After executing Docker Compose, you'll find a web site in the output folder. This page features multiple tabs, each offering distinct functionalities, and below, we will explain them

## Functionality Tabs
* **Tables:** Provides an overview of all tables in the database schema.
* **Columns:** Displays detailed information about columns within each table.
* **Constraints:** Offers insights into constraints applied to the database.
* **Relationships:** Visualizes the relationships between different tables.
* **Orphan Tables:** Identifies tables without established relationships.
* **Anomalies:** Highlights any irregularities or anomalies in the schema.
* **Routines:** Presents information about stored routines or procedures.

## Accessing Example

In the provided example, we showcase a demo utilizing a synthetic database called Synthea. Synthea is a state-of-the-art synthetic data generation tool designed for creating realistic, yet entirely fictitious, patient records and healthcare data. It enables the simulation of diverse medical scenarios, making it a valuable resource for testing and development purposes in the healthcare domain.
